# StreamlitApp

This is my first project testing out awesome Streamlit library. Looking forward to put more engaging ML/DL projects out using Streamlit. Feel free to clone this repo if you want to try out.

## How to run my Simple Streamlit App:
First install streamlit from termininal by typing this to terminal:

`pip install streamlit`

And test that installation is working:

`streamlit hello`


And now after that clone my repo, by simply typing this to terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/Sphagnumshuffle/StreamlitApp.git`

After that cd into that folder, for example for me I do this:

`cd ~/Documents/Data_Science/Streamlit/StreamlitApp`

Now you are ready to test this simple app. Just run the app by typing this to terminal:

`streamlit run simple_app.py`

And you should see app running in your browser. Have fun!
